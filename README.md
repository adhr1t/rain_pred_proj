# Australian Rain Predictor: Project Overview
*   Created a tool that predicts if there will be rainfall in Australia (Accuracy ~ .87; AUC ~ .87) to communicate weather patterns and tendencies
*   Cleaned over 150,000 weather documentations from various cities across Australian
*   Built Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM Classifier models
*   Tuned models by testing the efficacity of Normalizing and Resampling variables; Normalizing improved model performance and Resampling was deleterious
*   Optimized Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifiers using Pipeline and GridsearchCV to reach the best model

# Code and Resources Used
